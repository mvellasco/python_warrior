## Python Warrior Player

This repo contains my base Player class for the [python-warrior](https://github.com/arbylee/python-warrior) game.

This is a very fun game, made to teach python and the very basics of artifial inteligence.

The code makes the warrior reach the top of the tower and save the Python princess in EPIC mode at the beginner level, but that's good enough for now ðŸ™‚.
